# Mommy

Mommy is a Python web system designed to manage my mother's earnings, providing
time and efficiency in her financial control.

All documentation is in the `docs` directory, which is constantly updated to
understand better how the project works.

## Technologies

- Languages used on the frontend: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- Languages used on the backend: **Python** and **Flask**.

## Code Standardization

Having a consistent code is very important; it would be no different, even as
a "small" project. Therefore, I chose the following tools to maintain good
practices: **Prettier**, **Black**, **isort**, and **Flake8**.
