# Mommy

Mommy is a Python web system designed to manage my mother's earnings, providing
time and efficiency in her financial control.

All documentation is in the `docs` directory, which is constantly updated to
understand better how the project works.

## Important Note

I already developed this project in PHP (with fewer features and another
interface).

This repository's main objective is to train my skills in code maintenance.
After that, I'll change the PHP system she uses to this one.

Currently, the essential features are ready (mostly bad practices), so it's
time to make the code friendly and readable, and of course, a beautiful and
consistent interface.

## Technologies

- Languages used on the frontend: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- Languages used on the backend: **Python** and **Flask**.

## Code Standardization

Having a consistent code is very important; it would be no different, even as
a "small" project. Therefore, I chose the following tools to maintain good
practices: **Prettier**, **Black**, **isort**, and **Flake8**.
